# NAME

DEMOS - put up the button control panel for the demos

# SYNOPSIS

**DEMOS**

# DESCRIPTION

*DEMOS* assumes that you are standing in a copy of the
"\`get_esps_base\`/demo" directory, and all the subdirectories of that
directory exist and are readable. The *files*, *commands* and
*param_files* subdirectories must be writable, and the files in the
*scripts* directory must be exectuable. All other subdirectories must be
searchable by you and the files in the subdirectories must be readable.
*DEMOS* also assumes that you are running X windows; nothing will work,
if you are not.

*DEMOS* is a shell script that runs *mbuttons* (1-ESPS) and presents a
button panel for viewing several combination ESPS and waves+ demos. If
you do not have both ESPS and *waves+*, most of the demos will not work.
See the README in the "\`get_esps_base\`/demo" directory for additional
information.
